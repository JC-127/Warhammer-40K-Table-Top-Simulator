# Warhammer 40K Table Top Simulator

## Project Description
This table top simulator will allow Warhammer 40K fans to play their favorite missions and campaigns digitally. This simulator will have a multiplayer feature of up to 8 players with a minimum of 3 (2 for the party and 1 for the "Campaign Manager") players. The simulator will ensure that any lore, any stats, and any rules from the physical game will be transferred over successfully so the need of physical models will not be needed or rule books. This simulator will also allow players to customize and pick factions or “Armies” from the Warhammer 40K universe to ensure full player customizability.

## Educational Relevance
The project is linked to this class by implementing a simulator for the table top game Warhammer 40K. This would involve the use of GUIs as well as ensure the actions and capabilities of the player are transferred from a physical table top to a digital simulator which will include the generation of a Die. This project also ensures that the developers are able to make models, rules, and stats from the physical rule book to the digital simulator. Developers will also be able to ensure that they are able to adapt to wanted sudden changes given by the players.

## Project Contribution
My contribution to this project will be the implementing of models as well as ensuring that the rules of the game are correctly implemented. I will also ensue that when implementing the models, that there will be the 40K factions to choose from and they are able to customize their models and armies. The use of a GUI will also be implemented by me to ensure that when players are trying to customize their armies and models, that everything is functional. Any other contributions to the overall project will be documented later.

## Background
- Familiarity with using Java.
- Familarity with using and implementing GUIs.
- Familiarity with game design.
- IDE debugger will ensure there are no errors, so use this frequently.

***Building***
- Java based IDE is preferred since the implementation of a GUI in Java is easier.
- Java debugger frequently used will ensure minimal errors of logic flaw. 

**Running**
- Still a Work In Progress so expect it not to be created or implemented yet.

## Required Resources
- Any IDE that can implement the use of a GUI.
- Knowledge of game programming.
- Knowledge of the use of game "engines" for development purposes.
